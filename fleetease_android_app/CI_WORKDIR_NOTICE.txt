CI must run Flutter commands inside:
fleet-management-system-179272-179281/fleetease_android_app

From repo root, run one of:
- bash run_flutter_ci_robust.sh
- ./flutterw analyze && CI=true ./flutterw test -r expanded
- bash run_mobile_checks.sh
- bash universal_mobile_ci.sh

If you see: "Could not determine project root directory for Flutter project"
It means Flutter ran outside the app directory above.
