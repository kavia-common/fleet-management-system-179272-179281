For automated tooling and CI:
- The Flutter project root is this directory: fleet-management-system-179272-179281/fleetease_android_app
- Run Flutter commands from here:
    flutter pub get
    flutter analyze
    flutter test

If your CI runner executes from the monorepo root, set working_directory to:
  fleet-management-system-179272-179281/fleetease_android_app
