# CI Workflow Hint

Flutter commands must be executed from:
fleet-management-system-179272-179281/fleetease_android_app

Examples:
- cd fleet-management-system-179272-179281/fleetease_android_app && flutter pub get && flutter analyze && CI=true flutter test
- bash ci.sh
- bash run_flutter_checks.sh
- make analyze
- make test

If your CI system runs at repository root by default, change the working directory to the app path above before invoking Flutter.
